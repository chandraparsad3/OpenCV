# OpenCV Basic Implementations

This repository contains basic implementations of OpenCV functions. I learned these functions from the OpenCV Python Course by freeCodeCamp. You can watch the course here: [OpenCV Python Course by freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?si=j9nqvniIgyvEPG-I).

Feel free to update and improve the code, and contribute back with any new implementations or enhancements. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request to share your improvements with others.

Once again, I would like to thank freeCodeCamp for the course from which I learned these techniques. You can access the full course [here](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?si=j9nqvniIgyvEPG-I).
